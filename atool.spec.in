%description
atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
tar+gzip, zip etc).

The main command is aunpack which extracts files from an archive. Did you
ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the files were
located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting
in files scattered all over the place? aunpack overcomes this problem by
first extracting to a new directory, and if there was only a single file in
the archive, moving that file to the original directory. aunpack also
prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.

The other commands provided are apack (to create archives), als (to list
files in archives), and acat (to extract files to standard out).
