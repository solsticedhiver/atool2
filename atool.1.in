.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page document describes the \fBatool\fP commands.
These commands are used for managing file archives of various
types, such as tar and Zip archives. Each command can be
executed individually or by giving the appropriate options
to \fBatool\fP (see \fBOPTIONS\fP below).
.PP
\fBaunpack\fP extracts files from an archive. Often one wants
to extract all files in an archive to a single subdirectory.
However, some archives contain multiple files in their root
directories. The aunpack program overcomes this problem by
first extracting files to a unique (temporary) directory, and
then moving its contents back if possible. This also prevents
local files from being overwritten by mistake.
.PP
\fBapack\fP creates archives (or compresses files). If no file
arguments are specified, filenames to add are read from standard in.
.PP
\fBals\fP lists files in an archive.
.PP
\fBacat\fP extracts files in an archive to standard out.
.PP
\fBadiff\fP generates a diff between two archives using
diff(1).
.PP
\fBarepack\fP repacks archives to a different format. It does
this by first extracting all files of the old archive into a
temporary directory, then packing all files extracted to
that directory to the new archive. Use the \-\-each (\-e) option in
combination with \-\-format (\-F) to repack multiple archives using a
single invocation of atool. Note that arepack will not remove the old
archive.
.PP
Unless the \fB\-\-format\fP (\fB\-F\fP) option is provided,
the archive format is determined by the archive file extension. I.e.
an extension ".tar.gz" or ".tgz" means tar+gzip format. Note that
the extensions are checked in the order listed in the section
\fBARCHIVE TYPES\fP below, which is why a file with extension ".tar.gz"
is considered to a be tar+gzip archive, not a gzip compressed file.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List files in archive.
This option is automatically assumed when \fBals\fP is executed.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-extract
Extract files from archive.
This option is automatically assumed when \fBaunpack\fP is executed.
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-extract-to\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Extract files from archive to the specified directory. When
unpacking compressed files, PATH may refer to either a filename
or an existing directory.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-add
Create archive.
This option is automatically assumed when \fBapack\fP is executed.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cat
Extract a file from archive to standard out (displaying it on
screen).
This option is automatically assumed when \fBacat\fP is executed.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-diff
Extract two archives and use diff(1) to generate differencies
between them.
This option is automatically assumed when \fBadiff\fP is executed.
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-each
For each argument, execute the specified command. This can be used
to quickly extract, list or create multiple archives (see \fBEXAMPLES\fR
below). This option can not be used with the cat command.
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-format\fR=\fIEXTENSION\fR
Specify archive format manually (see \fBARCHIVE TYPES\fR below).
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-simulate
Run atool in simulation mode. No changes to the filesystem
(i.e. writes) will be made, and all commands that would be
executed are displayed instead. This option can't be combined
with \fB\-\-explain\fP (since it implies that already).

Note that it is not guaranteed that the commands printed in
simulation mode will be the same as those executed in non-
simulation mode. This is because some operations depend on
what files archives contain, and atool can at this time
only determine that by extracting archives.
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-explain
Display commands executed by atool. This option can't be combined
with \fB\-\-simulate\fP.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-page
Run output through a pager, usually \fBpager\fP unless the environment
variable \fBPAGER\fP is set.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
When extracting from files, allow overwriting of local files.
When creating an archive, allow the archive file to be overwritten
if it already exists. Note that it is possible to add files to
existing RAR and Zip archives (this is not possible for many
other formats).
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-subdir
When extracting archives, always create a new directory for
the archive even if the archive only contains one file in
its root directory.
.TP
.B \-0, \-\-null
If no file arguments are specified when creating or adding files
to archives, the list of files will be read from standard in.
Normally these filenames are separated by newline, but with this
option they are separated by null-bytes. This is useful with the
GNU find \-print0 option.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Decrease verbosity level by one. This is subtracted from the
default verbosity level, or the level specified
with \fB\-\-verbosity\fP. This option may be specified more than
once to make atool even less verbose.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity level by one. This is added to the
default verbosity level, or the level specified
with \fB\-\-verbosity\fP. This option may be specified more than
once to make atool even more verbose.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-verbosity\fR=\fILEVEL\fR
Specify verbosity level. The default level is 1,
which means "normal verbosity" - e.g. when creating and
extracting from archives, files will be listed.
.TP
.B \-\-config\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Load configuration from the specified file. When using this
option, the system-wide and user-wide configuration files
will not be loaded. If the specified file does not exist or
can not be read, atool will terminate with an error message.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-option\fR=\fIKEY=VALUE\fR
Override a configuration option. These are applied after
reading the configuration files.

You can specify this multiple times to override different options.
.TP

.B \-O, \-\-format\-option\fR=\fIOPTION\fR
Send additional options to the archiver command. This can be useful
when specifying compression options for some archives, e.g.
.br
        \fBapack \-F7z \-O-mx=9 archive.7z dir\fP
.br
You can specify this multiple times add different options.
.TP
.B \-\-save\-outdir\fR=\fIFILE\fR
When extracting files, save the name of the directory which
the archive was extracted to to the specified file. If the
command was not `extract', or the archive was not extracted to
a new directory, then nothing will be written to the specified
file. If multiple archives were specified (with \-e), then
only the last directory that files were extracted to will be
written to FILE.

This option is used internally (see \fBEXAMPLES\fR below).
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Output version information and exit.
.SH ARCHIVE TYPES
Unless the \-f (\-\-format) option is provided, the archive format
is determined by the archive file extension. I.e. an extension
".tar.gz" or ".tgz" means tar+gzip format. Note that the extensions
are checked in the other listed above, which is why a file
with extension ".tar.gz" is considered to a tar+gzip archive,
not a gzip archive.
.PP
The diff command is supported whenever the extract command is
supported.
.PP
The supported archive types are:
.TP
.RI \fBtar+gzip\fP " " ( .tar.gz ", " .tgz )

.SH CONFIGURATION
Since version 0.8.0, atool can read custom configuration files.
First, hardcoded defaults in the atool program file are evaluated.
Then system-wide configuration values are loaded from
\fI/etc/atool.conf\fR if that file exists. Finally, per-user
configuration values are loaded from \fI.atoolrc\fR in the current
user's home directory.
.PP
The format of the configuration files is simple:
.IP
variable value
.PP
Here \fBvariable\fR is a variable listed below, and \fBvalue\fR is the
value to associate the variable with. \fBvariable\fR and \fBvalue\fR
should be separated with at least one whitespace (space, tab etc). Empty
lines and lines beginning with # are discarded.
.PP
A value of `1' means that the option is enabled, and `0'
that it is disabled. Strings should not be quoted, as they start at
the first non-whitespace character and end at the end of the line.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B use_tar_bzip2_option \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-bzip2\fP option
for filtering bzip2'ed files through bzip2. Versions 1.13.6
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-bzip2\fP. Therefore, if you use
GNU tar earlier than 1.13.6, you will need to disable this option.

This used to be \fBuse_tar_j_option\fP but using \-\-bzip2 is more portable.
.TP
.B use_tar_lzip_option \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-lzip\fP option
for filtering lzip'ed files through lzip. Versions 1.23
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-lzip\fP. Therefore, if you use
GNU tar earlier than 1.23, you will need to disable this option.
.TP
.B use_tar_z_option \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-z\fP option
for filtering gzipped files through gzip. You will need to disable
this and \fIuse_tar_j_option\fR if you don't use GNU tar.

Disabling these two options doesn't mean that atool can't
extract bzip2/gzip files. If disabled, atool use a pipe to
send output from bzip2/gzip to tar instead.

If possible, these options should be enabled since error
management is better when filtering is done by tar.
.TP
.B use_tar_lzma_option \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-lzma\fP option
for filtering lzma compressed files through lzma. Versions 1.20
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-lzma\fP.
.TP
.B use_tar_lzop_option \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-lzop\fP option
for filtering lzop compressed files through lzop. Versions 1.21
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-lzop\fP.
.TP
.B use_tar_xz_option \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-xz\fP option
for filtering xz compressed files through xz. Versions 1.22
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-xz\fP.
.TP
.B use_tar_zstd_option \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you use GNU tar and it supports the \fB\-\-zstd\fP option
for filtering zstd compressed files through zstd. Versions 1.31
or later of GNU tar support \fB\-\-zstd\fP.
.TP
.B use_gzip_for_z \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you want to use gzip instead of uncompress when
decompressing compress'ed files (`.Z' files).
.TP
.B use_rar_for_unpack \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to always use rar instead of unrar
when possible. This makes atool use the rar command
(path_rar) even when listing and extracting RAR files.
.TP
.B use_arc_for_unpack \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to always use arc instead of nomarch
when possible. This makes atool use the arc command
(path_arc) even when listing and extracting ARC files.
.TP
.B use_arj_for_unpack \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to always use arj instead of unarj
when possible. This makes atool use the arj command
(path_arj) even when listing and extracting ARJ files.
.TP
.B use_find_cpio_print0 \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if find supports the \-print0 option and cpio supports
the \-0 option. Without it, it is impossible/harder to make cpio
archives of files with newline characters in their names.
.TP
.B extract_deb_control \fR(default: 1)\fR
Debian .deb package files contain control information in a DEBIAN
directory, especially the package's "control" file. Enable this if
you want the control information to be exctracted during extraction in
addition to the normal files.
.TP
.B strip_unknown_ext \fR(default: 1)\fR
Certain types of files are actually archives, but their extensions
doesn't tell so. Examples are Open Office documents (Zip files) and
Gnumeric documents (gzip'ed files). Since the extensions of those
filenames are unknown to atool, they would not be stripped with
this option set to 0. The output file in that case would be something
like Unpack-XYZW. Setting this option to 1 will cause the extension
to be stripped instead.
.TP
.B use_pbzip2 \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to use pbzip2 rather than bzip2.
Please not that if use_tar_bzip2_option is enabled, then
bzip2 will be used by tar regardless of the use_pbzip2
option. So if you want tar to use pbzip2 rather than bzip2,
set use_pbzip2 to 1 and use_tar_bzip2_option to 0.
.TP
.B use_lbzip2 \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to use lbzip2 rather than bzip2.
Please not that if use_tar_bzip2_option is enabled, then
bzip2 will be used by tar regardless of the use_lbzip2
option. So if you want tar to use lbzip2 rather than bzip2,
set use_lbzip2 to 1 and use_tar_bzip2_option to 0.
.TP
.B use_pigz \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to use pigz rather than gzip.
Please not that if use_tar_z_option is enabled, then
gzip will be used by tar regardless of the use_pigz
option. So if you want tar to use pigz rather than gzip,
set use_pigz to 1 and use_tar_z_option to 0.
.TP
.B use_plzip \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to use plzip rather than lzip.
Please not that if use_tar_lzip_option is enabled, then
lzip will be used by tar regardless of the use_plzip
option. So if you want tar to use plzip rather than lzip,
set use_plzip to 1 and use_tar_lzip_option to 0.
.TP
.B use_jar \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want to use jar for managing jar
archives. If you disable this option, zip will be
used (which should work just as well, and probably be
faster too).

This option is disabled by default since extracting
files to standard out (`cat') is not supported by jar.
.TP
.B use_file \fR(default: 1)\fR
Enable this if you want atool to identify file types
using file(1) for those files with an unrecognized
extension (or none at all).
.TP
.B use_file_always \fR(default: 0)\fR
Enable this if you want atool to always identify archives
using file(1), regardless of the file extension. Please note
that this currently has some drawbacks, such as not being able
to identify all archive types (especially tar archives compressed
with 7zip, lzop, szip etc).
.TP
.B tmpdir_name \fR(default: Unpack-%04d)\fR
atool extracts to a temporary directory created in the current
directory so that no files are overwritten. This variable
controlls what name that temporary directory should have.

The `%d' string in this variable will be replaced with a random
number between 0 and 9999. It is possible change the format
of this number by using something else than `%d' - see printf(3).
.TP
.B tmpfile_name \fR(default: Pack-%04d)\fR
When using pbzip2, and creating archives, a temporary file need
to be created. This option controls the name of that file.
See tmpdir_name for further details on the format.
.TP
.B path_pager \fR(default: pager)\fR
.TP
.B path_jar \fR(default: jar)\fR
.TP
.B path_tar \fR(default: tar)\fR
.TP
.B path_zip \fR(default: zip)\fR
.TP

.TP
.B path_pigz \fR(default: pigz)\fR
.TP
.B path_cabextract \fR(default: cabextract)\fR
.TP
.B path_7z \fR(default: 7z)\fR
.TP
.B path_unalz \fR(default: unalz)\fR
.TP
.B path_lha \fR(default: lha)\fR
.TP
.B path_unace \fR(default: unace)\fR
.TP
.B path_ar \fR(default: ar)\fR
.TP
.B path_arj \fR(default: arj)\fR
.TP
.B path_unarj \fR(default: unarj)\fR
.TP
.B path_arc \fR(default: arc)\fR
.TP
.B path_nomarch \fR(default: nomarch)\fR
.TP
.B path_rpm \fR(default: rpm)\fR
.TP
.B path_rpm2cpio \fR(default: rpm2cpio)\fR
.TP
.B path_dpkg_deb \fR(default: dpkg-deb)\fR
.TP
.B path_cpio \fR(default: cpio)\fR
.TP
.B path_file \fR(default: file)\fR
.TP
.B path_find \fR(default: find)\fR
.TP
.B path_xargs \fR(default: xargs)\fR
.TP
.B path_cat \fR(default: cat)\fR
.TP
.B path_diff \fR(default: diff)\fR
These are all paths to the corresponding programs. It is usually
best to leave them as is, because that way their locations can be
looked up from the PATH variable.
.TP
.B args_diff \fR(default: \-ru)\fR
This variable specifies command line arguments to pass to the
diff command (as specified by path_diff) when using adiff. Space
characters separate arguments in this string.
.TP
.B path_syscfg \fR(default: /etc/atool.conf)\fR
(This variable can only be set in the atool program file.)
This variable specifies the directory where the system-wide
configuration file is located.
.TP
.B path_usercfg \fR(default: .atoolrc)\fR
(This variable can only be set in the atool program file
and system-wide configuration file.)
This variable specifies where the user configuration file
is located. Note that if this filename is relative (i.e. doesn't
being with `/'), it will be relative to the current user's home
directory (as determined by the HOME environment variable).
.TP
.B default_verbosity \fR(default: 1)\fR
This is the default verbosity of atool. By using \-q and \-v
options, the verbosity level can be raised and lowered.
Level 1 means "normal verbosity" - e.g. when creating and
extracting from archives, files will be listed.
.TP
.B show_extracted \fR(default: 1)\fR
If this is set to 1, the aunpack command will always show
what file or directory that was extracted. Otherwise
that will only be printed if the archive was extracted to
an unexpected location (as a result of local files already
existing or the archive having multiple files in its root
directory).

This can be quite useful in combinatiaon with `default_verbosity 0'.
Note that this option will have no effect when the \-X option is used
with aunpack, and it has no effect on compressed files.
.TP
.B keep_compressed \fR(default: 1)\fR
When compressing a file with gzip or bzip2, the original (uncompressed)
file is usually deleted once it has been compressed. I.e. if you
compress a file "test" you will end up with only one file, "test.gz".
With this option set to 1, you will make atool keep the original file
as well. The original behaviour is achieved by setting this option to 0.

This option also has an equivalent effect on uncompressing compressed
files. When set to 1, the original (compressed) file will be kept.
Otherwise it will be deleted.

Note however that this option has no effect when packing up a compressed
file with the \-X option (for specifying an output directory or file). In
that case the original file is always kept.
.TP
.B decompress_to_cwd \fR(default: 1)\fR
When decompressing a file with commands such as gzip or bzip2, the
decompressed file is usually placed in the same directory as the
compressed file. With this option set to 1, the decompressed file is
instead placed in the current working directory.

Note that this option has no effect when \-X is used.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.B PAGER
The default pager to use when the \-p/\-\-page option is specified.
.SH EXAMPLES
To extract all files from archive `foobar.tar.gz' to a subdirectory
(or the current directory if it only contains one file):
.br
	\fBaunpack foobar.tar.gz\fP
.PP
To extract all files from all `.tar.gz' archives in the
current directory:
.br
	\fBaunpack \-e *.tar.gz\fP
.PP
To create a zip archive of two files `foo' and `bar':
.br
	\fBapack myarchive.zip foo bar\fP
.PP
To display the file `baz' in the archive `myarchive.zip'
through a pager:
.br

To list contents of the rar archive `stuff.rar':
.br
	\fBals stuff.rar\fP
.PP
To create three archives, `dir1.tar.gz', `dir2.tar.gz' and `dir3.tar.gz',
so that the first one contains all files in dir1, the second all
in dir2 and the third all dir3:
.br
	\fBapack \-e \-F .tar.gz dir1 dir2 dir3\fP
.PP
To show all differences between version 2.4.17 and 2.4.18 of the kernel:
.br
	\fBadiff linux-2.4.17.tar.gz linux-2.4.18.tar.gz\fP
.PP
To repack all .tar.gz archives in the current directory to .tar.7z (the
old archive will be kept untouched):
.br
	\fBarepack \-F.tar.7z \-e *.tar.gz\fP
.PP
Here's a shell function that will make the aunpack command change into the
directory where files were extracted:
.br
	\fBaunpack () {\fP
.br
	\fB  TMP=`mktemp /tmp/aunpack.XXXXXXXXXX`\fP
.br
	\fB  atool \-x \-\-save-outdir=$TMP "$@"\fP
.br
	\fB  DIR="`cat $TMP`"\fP
.br
	\fB  [ "$DIR" != "" \-a \-d "$DIR" ] && cd "$DIR"\fP
.br
	\fB  rm $TMP\fP
.br
	\fB}\fP
.br
If you don't have the mktemp program, you can replace the second line with
(note however that this is not entirely safe)
.br
	\fB  TMP="/tmp/atool_outdir.$$"\fP

.SH KNOWN BUGS
Trying to extract gzip and other compressed files without the .gz (or .bz2
etc) extension won't work:
.PP
  aunpack: foo: format not known, identifying using file
  aunpack: foo: format is `gzip'
  gzip: foo: unknown suffix -- ignored
.PP
This last error above is generated by \fBgzip \-d foo\fP.
